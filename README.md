#AI Tools Required:

# Explanation:
Experiment the persona pattern as a programmer for any specific applications related with your interesting area. 
Generate the outoput using more than one AI tool and based on the code generation analyse and discussing that.

Exp 6 : Development of Python Code Compatible with
Multiple AI Tools
 Objective
To develop and implement a Python program that automates interaction
with multiple AI APIs, compares their outputs based on input prompts,
and generates actionable insights by evaluating response relevance,
quality, or structure.
 Tools & Technologies Used
 Python 3.11+
 Requests library (for API interaction)
 OpenAI API (for text generation)
 Cohere AI API (alternative LLM)
 Google Generative AI (Gemini) API (optional)
 Pandas (for tabular comparison)
 JSON (for parsing and formatting responses)
 Workflow Overview
 Accept user prompt
 Send prompt to multiple AI APIs
 Capture responses
 Compare responses side-by-side
 Generate basic insights (e.g., word count, similarity, tone
detection)
 Python Code: Multi-AI Integration Engine

# === Sample Use ===
if __name__ == "__main__":
user_prompt = "Explain how cloud computing helps in scalable
software deployment."
compare_responses(user_prompt)
 Output Sample (Tabular Format)
AI Model Word Count Key Insight
OpenAI GPT-3.5 112 Detailed, formal explanation
Cohere Command-R 87 More concise, practical summary
 Insights Extracted Automatically
 Response lengths (for depth evaluation)
 Keyword flags (actionability, neutrality, etc.)
 Tendency to give pros/cons or steps
 Style analysis (formal vs. casual)
 Result
The Python program successfully integrated with multiple AI APIs,
processed their responses to a shared prompt, and compared them with
automated metrics like word count and tone. This aids in making
informed decisions about which model suits a given task.
